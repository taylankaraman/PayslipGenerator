# Payslip Generator #

-Created a separate service for each functionality so I can test them separately if I need to.
-Displaying the payslip is a separate service since rather than displaying the payslip to the console,
 some other method might be used in the future. Or an extra display method might be added alongside consol.
 It would be easy to add that along with the test.
